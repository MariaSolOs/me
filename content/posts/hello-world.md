I always found the comma after the "Hello" a bit odd, but I'm no one to judge [the tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program#History).

I guess a good way to start is to tell you about my first "Hello, World!" program. I was in my second semester of my undergrad, giving programming a change although I was already nerdy enough to also get into coding.
